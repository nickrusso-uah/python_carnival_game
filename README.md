# python_carnival_game
-----------------------------------------------
Goal of this is to use LLMs (github copilot) to develop code calculating some game theory problems:

The Game:
carnival game where you need to throw rings and land them around the neck of a bottle. Each bottle and/or ring can have a different size affecting the difficulty of the throw. You get a certain number of points per completed throw, with harder throws being worth more. The objective function is to score as many points as possible with the given rings 

The Goal: Use an LLM to acomplish as many of the following objectives in the fastest time possible- will keep track of man hours spent 
1) Write a python genetic algorithm to determine the optimal strategy for some set of bottles, points per bottle, number of rings, etc
2) Write drivers to run monte carlos of many diverse runs and visualize results
3) use SciKitLean (or similar) to extract relevant features of good and bad solutions
